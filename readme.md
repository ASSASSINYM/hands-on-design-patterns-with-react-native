#### Hands-on Design Patterns with React Native

This is a public repository provided to a book readers and potential book readers. Here you can access full examples that are mentioned in a book but could not fit entirely. Each example is standalone and required you to install dependencies (`yarn install`) and expo run within that example directory (`yarn start`).

#### Author note

Frameworks and libraries come and go. Design patterns usually stay for longer. In this book we do a mix of learning React Native and design patterns relevant to this ecosystem.
I'm really happy I can share my experience and patterns that I have learnt. Hopefully you will use this knowledge to build well thought and easy to maintain codebases.
Good luck with this endeavours!
